I think if I start from the second from the bottom row, add the
current row with the higher row below it, store that value as
max_value. 

Then when iterating through the 3rd row, Add the 3rd row value to max_value
and store that in the 3rd rows max_value

Position Class
    Given vector, row index, and column index
    Can find max_value
